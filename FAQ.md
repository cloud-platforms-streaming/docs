# Red Hat Live Streaming Overview/FAQ

Handy link to this doc: https://red.ht/streamfaq

If this FAQ needs additional information, feel free to to submit a pull request or raise an issue.

Why live streaming? The COVID-19 pandemic has affected almost every event on the planet. We need a better way to connect to customers, partners, contributors, and communities.

The ideal situation is that this connection point remains a very natural and human experience. Think of it as a TV show with a live studio audience (in the form of chat) for all things Kubernetes and OpenShift but, a more relaxed environment where people are human and relatable.

## What’s our Twitch URL?

Shortened: https://red.ht/twitch  
Direct: https://www.twitch.tv/redhatopenshift

## Is there a public calendar?

Yes!

https://red.ht/streamcal

You can add this calendar to your own by clicking the “+Google Calendar” icon in the lower right-hand corner of the page.

## Have an idea for a live stream?

Please use the OpenShift Twitch Stream Topic Proposal Form. We are very welcoming of streams that involve customers, upstream contributors, Accelerators, Partners, etc. Please use the form to act as a steward and/or handoff from outside the company to inside.

**NOTE**: Twitch prefers longer streams. We’ve been told that at around the 2.5+ hours point, the Twitch algorithm will start showing us some love. With that being said, we will happily do streams one-hour in length or more.

## What are the needed roles to stream?

We see three “[Personas](https://github.com/cloud-platforms-streaming/streaming-docs#personas)” on every stream. Keep in mind that, in theory, all three Personas can be held by the same person:

* [Guests](https://github.com/cloud-platforms-streaming/streaming-docs#guests)
* [Producers](https://github.com/cloud-platforms-streaming/streaming-docs#producers)
* [Streamers](https://github.com/cloud-platforms-streaming/streaming-docs#streamers)

## What does it take to stream?

Building a great stream is not for the faint of heart. We’ve documented so much already with plenty more to document every day. Please make suggestions and add issues from your own experience participating in our streams. This is an open source project that we are working with upstream contributors to help other live streaming efforts.

## Can I run pre-recorded content?

Yes. But, let’s make sure it fits the platform and desired human connection. Please use the [OpenShift Twitch Stream Topic Proposal Form](https://red.ht/streamform).

## Can I run pre-recorded content [MST3000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Science_Theater_3000)-style?

Yes. In fact, if it is pre-recorded, this is our preferred model. However, ensure that the content you want to comment on is public and either re-streamable (copyright).  You must have permission to restream this content. For example, call the NFL if you want to talk over footage from a football game.
