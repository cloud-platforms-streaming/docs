# Continuity Plan

As of 2020-09-28

## People

Currently [Chris Short](https://github.com/chris-short) streams and produces (as well as, hosts as needed) the majority of shows on [openshift.tv](https://openshift.tv). But, in case Chris is unavailable due to technical or other issues we've lined up the following folks to help cover the [Streamers](https://github.com/cloud-platforms-streaming/streaming-docs#streamers) and [Producers](https://github.com/cloud-platforms-streaming/streaming-docs/blob/master/README.md#producers) responsibilities. Please understand, this isn't their full time responsibility and when working together, more communication is better than less:

* Erik Jacobs ([thoaraxe](https://github.com/thoraxe))  
* Langdon White ([langdon](https://github.com/langdon))  
* Ryan Jarvinen ([ryanj](https://github.com/ryanj))  
* Brian Tannous ([btannous](https://github.com/btannous))

As mentioned, these folks aren't doing this regularly as part of their day-to-day jobs. They are trained and technical folks but, please don't consider them as go to folks for producing bespoke shows or series.

Please use the [OpenShift Stream Topic Proposal](https://red.ht/streamform) form to propose topics for the channel.

## Process

If the slotted Streamer/Producer is unable to stream but, able to communicate they should inform the next in line of their issues and need to handoff responsibilities as soon as possible. If the next inline isn't available, keep going down the list.

If you plan on being out for prescheduled shows please find a replacement for yourself early. Be sure they have the same invites you have, and definitely check-in with them the day before to make sure they realize what year it is.

## Tools (or How)

Emailing and informing via [Slack](https://coreos.slack.com/archives/C01456K7G2H) all producers on this page of your issues is a critical step in the handoff process.

If you're able to hit up the Streaming channel on GChat, that's helpful too. But, as determined in the 2020-09-28 openshift.tv Production Meeting, the [Slack Streaming Channel](https://coreos.slack.com/archives/C01456K7G2H) is the official go to source for openshift.tv help, conversations, etc.

Thank you!
