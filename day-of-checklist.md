# Live Stream Day of Checklist

## Pre-Event Logistics

1. Pre-schedule the Zoom call (you'll need a paid account or someone with one)
1. Copy the invite details into a calendar invite including your Guests, Producer, and Streamer with a fifteen minute setup time ahead of the event.
1. Create an invite for the **public calendar**; include a description folks can use for social and add only redhatstreaming AT gmail DOT com to that invite. Include a link to Twitch (Not the Zoom details)
1. A public calendar maintainer will make sure the invite for public consumption is published
1. You need a stream key for OBS; ask Erik Jacobs or Chris Short. They should give you a key (hopefully unique to you but protect it like a password)

It's encouraged to test streaming with your own account(s) to get the hang of it

## Pre-stream

1. Establish a back channel to communicate with all participants. Slack or GChat are not recommended. Use the Zoom or BlueJeans chat (you're all in it automatically)
1. Download the streaming-tools repo (put it in /opt/)
1. Linux users: Install the [Linux Browser plugin](https://github.com/cloud-platforms-streaming/streaming-docs/blob/master/streamers-guide.md#linux-browser-plugin)
1. Check your OBS scenes are configured correctly. Zoom launches two windows; make sure the right Zoom window is seletecd in the Main Zoom Scenes -> Mac/Linux Zoom Window
1. Rotate through scenes make sure you're seeing what is expected
1. Get everyone on Zoom EARLY so you can test their setups
1. Make sure Side by Side in Zoom Settings is enabled (buried in Zoom settings)
1. Make sure you’re in Gallery View (not available until two people are on call)
1. Make sure font sizes look good when screen sharing
1. About 5 minutes before the scheduled stream start time; click Start Streaming on the “Starting Soon” Scene.
