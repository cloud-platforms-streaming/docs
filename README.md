# Streaming Docs

A great part about [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) and other streaming platforms is that you can stream from almost any device. This allows for more natural conversations. However, when you start pulling in multiple people for a chat, streaming it, adding graphics to the stream, etc. things can get complicated.

## Personas

Three main roles need to be played to do a stream. Guests, Producers, and Streamers. In reality, one person can do a stream by themselves. But, we call out these specific personas because they all have some requirements and responsibilities.

The number one rule of all these personas is the be authentic and transparent. Be you, be real. It's okay to make some mistakes during the live streams, that makes it very real for folks.

### Guests

Congrats! You're the star of the show! You've made it to a league, the size of which is to be determined. We want you to have the best experience possible. We want you to have fun and be the best version of you that you can be. Thank you for joining our stream.

All we ask is that you be able to join a Zoom call. We'd like you to be on a webcam, using a wired mic (stock Apple EarPods are sufficient), and able to share your screen if you intend to present anything or live code.

That's it! Join us and share your knowledge and experience.

If you're a regular guest you might want to consider acquiring equipment that we suggest in the [Streamers Guide](streamers-guide.md)

### Producers

"Producers" are the term for the folks that are managing the Twitch channel itself. There are many ways to interact with the audience, including chat, that are available to the Producers to provide a great experience.

TODO: Document extensions that are added to Twitch

One of the more important things is making sure the stream is adhering to community guidelines and make the experience fun and enjoyable for everyone on the stream.

* [Twitch Community Guidelines](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/)
* [YouTube Policies and Safety](https://www.youtube.com/about/policies/#community-guidelines)
* [FaceBook Community Standards](https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/)  
* [Twitter Rules and policies](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies#twitter-rules)  
Summary: Be excellent to everyone.

Producers are also the ones making sure we adhere to the [Rules for Streaming]()

### Streamers

Streamers are the ones that mux everything together out to the internet. Streamers are the folks that are responsible for getting everyone that's joined a Zoom call, adding in any customizations via [OBS](http://obsproject.com/), and streaming that feed out to the internet.

Streamers are the folks that will be the ones making sure the content lands on Twitch/YouTube/Facebook/Twitter/etc.

There are some requirements though for streaming that are best-maintained separate from this README.md.

## Rules for Streaming

Fun and natural but professional is the goal. The channel is not marked as mature on any platform so please be cognizant of language and environment.

* Read the Community Guidelines because they are very different than what you might think (like [Music](https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/community-guidelines/music/))
* Contribute to the docs and assets: https://github.com/cloud-platforms-streaming
* Don't get into open source drama/politics/etc. (Example: Chris Short will not be talking about behind the scenes CNCF goings-on)
* Don't knock competing projects and products (we all know this but, let's continue to stay above board here)
