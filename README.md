# Streaming Docs

A great part about Twitch and other streaming platforms, is that you can stream from almost any device. This allows for more natural conversations. However, when you start pulling in multiple people for a conversation, streaming, etc. things get complicated.

Streamers is the term we're using for the folks that are responsible for getting everyone on a call and streaming that out to the internet. Streamers are the folks that will be the ones making sure the stream actually lands on Twitch/YouTube/etc.

There are some requirements though for streaming. In general, the gotchas for streaming are:

## Bandwidth

If you have a lower end upload speed, streaming is possible but 720p and 1080p streams require at least 5 Mbps of bandwidth. Keep in mind, other things on your network contend for this bandwidth. While we don't intend to stream in 4K initially, the bandwidth requirements for broadcasting 4K video is 25 Mbps.

## Equipment

Streamers will need to consider how they will both broadcast a stream while participating in it. While this can be done with a powerful enough computer, many folks choose to use two computers to stream and participate. Computer A will be the box from which you speak and present to the audience (via a video teleconferencing solution). This is just like joining any other BlueJeans/Zoom/etc. call.

Computer B will be the machine that runs OBS to broadcast the video teleconferencing window to the streaming platforms. This computer should be able to handle the demand of streaming (for example, an Intel i3 is the baseline platform being recommended).

If your face is on camera, there is a good presentation put together by the brand team that will help you make the most of your appearance. Ideally, you have a decent mic, good lighting, and are wearing Red Hat or neutrally colored clothing: [Webcam Video
